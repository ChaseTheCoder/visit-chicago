# Visit Chicago

A basic landing page with one other route to learn Vue.js.  I love the story behind it's creation and that it's community backed.  

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## Libraries & Frameworks

* Vue.js

## Project Status

Very simple Home and About pages created to experience working with the framework.  It is currenlty deployed to Github.

## My Experience and Takeaways 

* The syntax of components I find is easier to manage than React.js.
* Routes are more intuitive to use once started.
* Componenets based programming makes it easier form me, a React developer, to scale up and build with Vue.js
* Having the <style> on the samge page allowed me to build componenents quicker wihtout having to go between files.
* The use of regular sytnax (class vs className with React) makes it more intuitive when building.

### Next Actions

Continue adding developing UI to make it look more modern. Adding more routes to build complexity of the app.
